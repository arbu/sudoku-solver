Sudoku Solver
-------------

This is simple approach of a Sudoku Solver. It is implemented using a backtracking algorithm, so nothing very fast or such.

The main purpose of writing this was for me to learn the basics of the <a href="http://www.nonelang.org/">None programming language</a>.

The code in this repository is free to use, but i am not responsible for anything that results from using it.
